title: Welcome to my blog

You will find here technical analysis on various APT / Cybercrime malware that I have been studying through the custom sandbox I'm currently developping.  
Raw dynamic results are available for more samples on my dedicated GitHub [Reflexions](https://github.com/cedricg-mirror/reflexions)  

I'll be happy to exchange with other researchers in the field of static or dynamic analysis, as well as provide some logs for any publicly available sample.
